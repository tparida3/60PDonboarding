setenv PEGASUS_DRC to the location of the deck installation which is in the "Sky130_DRC" directory.
 
The variable points to this directory so the dir pointed to by $PEGASUS_DRC  would have the contents:
   
   sky130_rev_0.0_1.0.drc.pvl
   Include/*.pvl
    
      
Run by pointing to the file $PEGASUS_DRC/sky130_rev_0.0_1.0.drc.pvl
