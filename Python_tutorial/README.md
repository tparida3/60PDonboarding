# Python Questions 

1. How many paths have negative slack (i.e., violated timing constraints)? 

2. What is the average depth (or number of gates) of paths with the smallest positive slack? 

3. What is this design's operating frequency? From a timing perspective, is there potential to achieve higher performance?

4. This timing report comes from the signoff stage of design (after routing). What is the first issue you notice in this report? 

5. How would you address the issue identified in question 4? Additionally, reconsider your answer to question 3 based on this observation.
